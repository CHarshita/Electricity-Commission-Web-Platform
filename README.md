Project Description

Our project is an Electricity Board website designed to make managing electricity services easy and convenient for users. The platform provides various features like secure user login, viewing the latest bill details, checking outage information, and tracking electricity usage through a detailed dashboard. Users can also register complaints, make quick bill payments, and apply for new electricity connections directly through the website.

We aimed to build a responsive, user-friendly interface that works smoothly across devices and browsers. By integrating APIs for real-time data and implementing secure backend operations for user authentication and data management, we ensured both functionality and security. The project combines technologies like ReactJS for dynamic frontend development, SQL for backend database operations, and standard web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overall, the website simplifies the electricity service experience by bringing all essential functions into one platform, enhancing user convenience and operational efficiency.
